Most solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) found on the Internet consist of procedural spaghetti code that is not very readable, let alone maintainable.

I therefore took the trouble to implement each task in a truly object-oriented and test-driven way, resulting in a solution made of small, comprehensible objects interacting with each other.
